# kerem (dot) ai

Machine Learning enthusiast. Computer Scientist. Experienced in developing scalable software systems and AI-driven applications, and working with cloud technologies. Committed to driving innovation and creating high-tech solutions that address real-world problems. Built two products from scratch, for one of which the team has applied to FDA approval.

It is me, Kerem, and this organization is supposed to serve my personal projects and provide space for collaborative work. You can access anything that I built so far.
